Agudat Yisrael, UTJ’s hassidic party, has not reached any agreement on the matter.. The financial sanctions will be waived for the first two years of the law’s existence.If the targets are missed for three years in a row after the first two years, the law will be voided, and all haredi men will be subject to the mandatory draft.The bill is not perfect and will not lead to full equality in the burden of national service.. This decision came after the previous Knesset – with a haredi-free coalition – passed a law setting rising enlistment targets and after the current one, with Shas and United Torah Judaism (UTJ) in the government, canceled it without replacing it.The deadline for enacting a new law was originally one year – which passed over a month ago – and then was postponed until December 2018.
