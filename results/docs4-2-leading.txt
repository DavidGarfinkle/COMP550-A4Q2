Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s coalition government announced Sunday that it will request an extension from the Supreme Court on an amendment to the nation’s draft law, enabling the narrow government to pass replacement legislation.. With just one week until the previous extension given by the Supreme Court ends, coalition leaders in Netanyahu’s narrow 61-member government announced plans to request a second extension.. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court granted a three-month extension, requiring the government to pass new legislation mandating the terms of army deferrals for yeshiva students by December 2nd, or face a termination of the deferral program with the lapsing of the existing law.
