Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking international law after a Russian border patrol seizure of three Ukrainian ships.. The naval vessels - two artillery ships and a tug boat - were bound for the Ukrainian port of Mariupol in the Sea of Azov.. This required them to pass through the Kerch Strait, a narrow strip of water being blocked by a Russian cargo ship.. Both sides are blaming each other and there has been a flurry of claims and counter-claims.
