Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before.. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going.. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall.. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analyses from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.. After Avigdor Liberman announced his resignation from the Defense Ministry, the entire political system went into a frenzy.
