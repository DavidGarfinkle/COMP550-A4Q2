When a prosecutor pulls the plug on a cooperator because that cooperator lies, it typically happens not merely because the prosecutor senses in his gut that the cooperator is lying.. Whatever the particular reason for the breakdown, there is no avoiding the conclusion that, had Manafort cooperated fully and truthfully, he likely could have done serious damage to high-ranking administration and campaign officials, including potentially Trump himself.. This selectivity is the most common cause of failed cooperation, and it appears to be Manafort's undoing here.. The failure of Manafort's cooperation at first glance seems like a setback for Mueller.. Translation: Manafort lied, I know it, and I'll prove it at his sentencing if necessary.
