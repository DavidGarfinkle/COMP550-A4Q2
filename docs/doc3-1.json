{"content": "According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the automaker was teetering on the edge of disaster earlier this year. \u201cTesla faced a really severe threat of death due to the Model 3 production ramp,\u201d Musk told Axios during a video interview on HBO. \u201cEssentially the company was bleeding money like crazy and just if we didn\u2019t solve these problems in a very short period of time, we would die. And it was extremely difficult to solve them.\u201d\n\nMusk said Tesla was within \u201csingle-digit weeks\u201d of an unrecoverable catastrophe. While we appreciate his present candor, the assertion doesn\u2019t mesh with comments made earlier.\n\nIn fact, Elon was down on the automotive firm needing more funds every since it posted its 2011 financial results. \u201cTesla does not need to ever raise another funding round,\u201d he said in response to a question on the company\u2019s cash position back in February of 2012. \u201cWe may want to do so, but we are in a strong cash position, and we don\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\nThat narrative has been revisited several times, with the most recent examples occurring this summer when Musk said Tesla would not be raising equity at any point. \u201cAre we running low on money? The answer is no,\u201d he said last August. The CEO even joked that the company had gone bankrupt for April Fool\u2019s Day 2018, in a snide response to industry analysts who claimed the automaker was quickly running out of cash.\n\nHowever, it appears the automaker actually needed quite a bit of funding to keep itself away from the cliffs of doom. Based on Musk\u2019s interview, the period where he was sleeping at the factory this summer was also the moment when Tesla was in the worst trouble. Meanwhile. automotive outlets \u2014 including this one \u2014 suggested Tesla\u2019s situation was more dire than it let on.\n\nFans of the brand didn\u2019t see it, however, and often had their rebuttals at the ready. While we\u2019d normally love to bask in the warmth of a well-earned \u201ctold you so,\u201d the mere fact that the public\u2019s trust in Tesla never seems to waiver is one of the reasons for its success. In fact, Musk\u2019s hype-driven narrative was probably an essential piece of Tesla\u2019s overall strategy. It accomplished its goals, eventually hitting Model 3 production targets without additional fundraising \u2014 albeit with some serious hiccups.\n\nMusk\u2019s attempt to take the company private was a big distraction over the summer and the Model 3 has still spent the majority of its life behind schedule. The Axios segment appears to illustrate just how beaten-down the process left the CEO. He admitted that nobody should work as hard as he did in 2018, adopting a defeated posture. \u201cIt hurts my brain and my heart,\u201d he explained.\u201dIt is not recommended for anyone. I just did it because if I didn\u2019t do it \u2026 there was a good chance Tesla would die.\u201d\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the company\u2019s leadership wasn\u2019t upfront about its situation. But when has that ever been the case with an automaker? They alway promise the moon while delivering the closest approximation they can muster. While this might feel like a slap in the face, it\u2019s really just another reason we should keep our eyes wide open when watching the industry.\n\n[Image: Tesla Motors]", "words": [["According",
